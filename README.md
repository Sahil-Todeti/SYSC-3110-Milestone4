# SYSC 3110 Project - Scrabble

This is a GUI-based version of the Scrabble game developed for Milestone 3. The project builds upon the older versions from Milestones 1 and 2, using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and Java’s Event Model to handle user interactions.

This version allows for 2-4 AI players. The AI uses backtracking to generate all permutations (2-7 letters) from its rack, validates each permutation against dictionary.txt using HashSet lookup, evaluates every board position with both directions, calculates scores including premium squares, and selects the highest-scoring legal move. If no feasible move exists, AI chooses to pass as per Scrabble rules.

### Milestone 5 (Bonus): Feature 3 – Game Statistics Display
- Selected Feature: Game Statistics Display (Feature 3),
- Gameplay: At the end of the game, a statistics dialog automatically appears showing: 
    - Number of turns taken by each player, 
    - Total points scored by each player, 
    - Words played by each player along with their individual scores, 
- Implementation: 
    - Tracking statistics per player added in src/scrabble/model/Player.java (turn count and per-word scores),
    - Stats recorded in src/scrabble/model/ScrabbleModel.java: 
       - On word placement, the word and its score are stored and the turn count increments,
       - On tile exchange and pass, the turn count increments, 
    - End-of-game UI in src/scrabble/view/GameStatsDialog.java: 
       - Summary table for Player, Turns, and Total Points, 
       - Tabbed view listing words and scores per player, 
    - Hooked into game flow in src/scrabble/view/ScrabbleView.java:
       - When a GAME_ENDED event is received, the Game Statistics dialog is displayed, 
- Contributors: 
  - Chukwuemeka Igwe: View hook on game end and UI polish, 
  - Sahil Todeti: Player model extensions for stats (turns, words, scores)
